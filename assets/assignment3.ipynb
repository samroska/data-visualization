    "### Important notes:\n",
    "1) There will be a couple of places where the numbers you get when you select rows may be a little different than 538, but the percents should still work (e.g., 828 instead of 834). You'll see this in our examples. If you can somehow get the data to match exactly, that's great too.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Grading for this assignment is entirely done by a human grader. They will be running tests on the functions we ask you to create. This means there is no autograding (submitting through the autograder will result in an error). You are expected to test and validate your own code. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Keep your notebooks clean and readable. If your code is highly messy or inefficient you will get a deduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Follow the instructions for submission on Coursera. You will be providing us a generated link to a read-only version of your notebook and a PDF. When turning in your PDF, please use the File -> Print -> Save as PDF option ***from your browser***. Do ***not*** use the File->Download as->PDF option. Complete instructions for this are under Resources in the Coursera page for this class. If you're having trouble with printing, take a look at [this video](https://youtu.be/PiO-K7AoWjk).\n",

    "This week, I caught a sneak peek [of the X-Wing fighter](http://www.wired.com/2014/07/star-wars-episode-vii-x-wing/) from the new “Star Wars” films in production. The forthcoming movies — and the middling response to the most recent trilogy — provide a perfect excuse to examine some questions I’ve long wanted answers to: How many people are “Star Wars” fans? Does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch? Which characters are most well-liked and most hated? And who shot first, Han Solo or Greedo?\n",

Seventy-nine percent of those respondents said they had watched at least one of the “Star Wars” films. This question, incidentally, had a substantial difference by gender: 85 percent of men have seen at least one “Star Wars” film compared to 72 percent of women. Of people who have seen a film, men were also more likely to consider themselves a fan of the franchise: 72 percent of men compared to 60 percent of women.\n",
